<strong>Nostromo (1981) PC-60</strong>. Possibly the first "Survival Horror" in history(?). A game where you have to collect resources while avoiding an alien.
How do you design a "survival horror" when the genre didn't even exist yet? Most likely, the creator wasn’t aiming to fit into any specific category—he simply wanted to offer a genuine experience.

Today, the game is broken; many of its design choices lack a solid foundation, and it's not fun to play.
